# Console Animations in cpp (C++)

This project is a collection of **console-based animations and graphics** built using C++ and mathematical functions.  
It demonstrates the use of trigonometry, geometry, and creative logic to animate shapes, patterns, and movements inside the terminal.

## 🎮 Features & Animations
- **Sine Wave Printing** – dynamic wave with changing amplitude and starting angle.
- **Rectangles & Boundary Rotation** – clockwise and anticlockwise rotations of matrix boundaries.
- **Name Printing Animation** – characters of a name grow, move, and animate in different directions.
- **Spiral Printing** – animated rectangular and polar spirals.
- **Rotating Fan** – ASCII-based fan animation with increasing speed.
- **Stone Throwing Simulation** – parabolic motion using physics equations.
- **Circle Printing & Balloon Animation** – dynamic circles expanding/shrinking, bursting with particles.
- **Smiley Faces** – printed using parametric equations.
- **Polar Spirals** – patterns drawn with sine/cos functions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Language: **C++**
- Core: Console Graphics, Windows API
- Math: Trigonometry, Geometry, Coordinate Transformations

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Compile using g++ (on Windows with MinGW):
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o animations
   ./animations
